%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   The ABSTRACT is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top
   of the left-hand column, below the author and affiliation
   information. Use the word ``Abstract'' as the title, in 12-point
   Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially
   capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type.
   Leave two blank lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text.
   Look at previous CVPR abstracts to get a feel for style and length.
\end{abstract}
